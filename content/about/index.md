Hi! I'm winnyace, or winny for short. This is my website/blog thingy I made.

I'm your average nerd and weeb. I plan to become a programmer/software developer/whatever you call someone who makes a computer go brrrr, I guess. I like video games, computers, anime and visual novels from time to time.

I made this to share my thoughts and opinions on things I believe to be interesting. I hope you'll enjoy it.
