Hi! I'm currently feeling sad, due to feeling lonely. I think writing here what I feel might help me pass through the feelings, so I'm sorry if you're reading expecting something nice.

Actually, who I am kidding? I don't know if anyone even reads this blog. I used to think that it is bad, that I'm not cool enough or something, but I'm starting to wonder if it is for the best or that it might be a sign that I'm just meant to be alone. Even online, I'm mostly ignored and stuff, even when I try to talk to people and stuff, but I think I should just accept it. I can't do much more than that, I think.

I admit that I'm not really the nicest person. I did manage to more or less kill all of my friend groups due to me being too toxic or needy or what-have-you. I was always somewhat lonely, I guess, and my social skills clearly too little for what I wanted to be at certain ages and stages of my life.

I'm also somewhat shy, especially due to feeling like I will just mess everything up and end up hurting myself even more. Trying to do something social ends up making feel uncomfortable. It's a bit of a miracle, I think, that I managed to make this blog. It's also why I didn't post for a long time, but I think I will actually just use this blog for what it is. Again, I don't think anyone besides me reads this and the occasional person that might come in to check what is up with that link I've in my Discord bio. 

I'm currently not sure what to do. I think I should just try to accept my situation and move on with my life, as is. I'm not sure how long I would live or what I would be able to achieve, but I think it would best for everyone to just not mix in anyone's way. Yeah, I guess I will I've said enough. I'm sorry, yet again, for anyone who had the displeasure to read this. Currently, a part of me wants to ask you to contact me up, but another just tells me to not do it, so I'll do both at the same time in the form of this sentence you're reading. I will try to come up here often, with something. Again, no one reads this, so I might just use it for my little, sad, not great corner of the web. See ya.
