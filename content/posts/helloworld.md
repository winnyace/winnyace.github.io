Hello, world!
I'm currently still trying to put everything together for the blog and website. right now, for some reason, the new style isn't being implemented, which is kind of annoying. I had to delete my previous repo for this to work, sadly. it's fine now, though. I'm glad how well this turned up to be. now, for the future. I'm not too sure what I will do here, but I know I want to do something and hopefully share on my little bit of knowledge I've and leave my mark on this world, somehow. I'll probably talk about... whatever goes through my mind at a current time about a topic, really. we'll see. for the time being, though, hello world!
