- 'osu! Improvement Week 2022'
---

This week was mostly about getting started with this and trying to enter into a routine. I wanted to play around the same time every single day, but there are a few challenges to that. back in 2020, I used to play around 10-11AM in the morning, for a hour or two, almost every single day. considering I've other things on my plate nowadays, though, I can't exactly do that, but I think skipping a day or two won't be the end of the world.

another thing I tried to do is to try to keep playing even on a bad day. I've spent this week mostly derusting and trying to force myself to keep going, no matter what. I believe this is the true challenge of improvement at anything: the mindset you've towards it. if you want results from the get go, you'll fail to meet them. this happens to me, all the time. I've very high expectations of myself and I'm too impatient with myself as well. real improvement takes time, sometimes a lot of time, and a lot of effort as well  and we can easilyblock progress by being so judgmental over our own performance.  this is something that will take me some time, I believe. it's just something I've to accept: it will take time to see results. I plan that on bad days to try and play things that I know I can't really play exclusively. since I can't really play such maps, I don't have high expectations of me to do well, so I can impress myself without a ton of work.

for the moment, I don't have very specific goals, but I should get very soon. a problem I've with goals, however, is how unrealistic I make them. I said once to myself that if I put in the effort to FC [oddloop](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/536872/#osu/1142960") I can do it. well, yes, that's true, but it's a very difficult map for me currently, especially the ending. the map requires a lot of precise aim, something I'm currently trying to get back and continue working on, as well as reading. my goals have to be something I can reasonably do. I'll see what will be able to come up with and I will share them here.

I'm gonna be honest: I didn't exactly put much effort this week into this. I'm trying to figure out how to make this as well. I think I will take notes during the play session, so for each day there's something more concrete,  not just this vagueness I did this week. I also want to post the scores I believe to be good to great as well and maybe try to narrate these little blogs and make a little video each week for them. I will think about it. if you've an idea or you just want to give me feedback, you can always find my contact information on this blog. I'm most active on Discord.

that's for the moment. thanks for reading!
