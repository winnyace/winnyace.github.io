I was at my computer, like I always am. Just finished my cycling session and I was really bored, and I saw a Vtuber meme which had a low quality version of Candyland by Tobu, released by NCS, I think(?). Out of my boredom, I decided to actually search for the meme. I’ve enjoyed for the… 10 seconds that it is funny, and then, out of nowhere, I got the title of a song from my childhood in my head: Imaginary Friends by Laszlo, also released by NCS. I suppose, I should explain a bit. 

For as long as I can remember, I’ve watched YouTube videos. It is, by far, my most visited website on the Internet and represents a huge majority of the content I watch regularly, even today. When I was small, around 10-11, years old, I was extremely into Minecraft and during that era, a lot of what the youtubers I’ve watched were doing Minecraft videos and more specifically Minecraft PVP. And a lot of them used songs from NCS. I remember one youtuber who used that song in the background for one of his survival games series. It was a really beautiful moment when I finally found that song. 

And with little song, I remembered a lot of things of my childhood... I’m certainly not 60 years old or anything, but it is still nostalgic for me to remember a time when I was more youthful and innocent. I used to add random people on Skype, yeah Skype, and play Minecraft with them. I used to use a CRT monitor. I used to have a Pentinum 4. I used to make videos on that poor Pentinum 4! Yeah, haha! [Search DerFlash on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/KillerGamingOldschoolGaming) (it’s in Romanian, but still) and you will find my old attempts at making videos. It is hilariously cringey and corny but man, I was actually trying things back then. That’s something I can’t do it easily. Man… what a time was back then. It’s a time now too, don’t get me wrong, but it’s more weird now… perhaps I’m just more self-aware of my own being than I used to. I certainly need to be more like a kid and just try things, for the sake of trying them. Perhaps that will help me grow as an individual.

I’ve quite a bit of embarrassing stuff to talk about my past, but that’s for another time, I think.
