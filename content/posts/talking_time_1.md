Yo! Long time no see. I have began university, at computer science. Things have been mixed, but mostly well. I kinda just want to do a post to say that I'm here and I want to do stuff here. Not sure what, but I know want to do stuff.

I wanna try to do blog posts that talk about random stuff, either in my life or online that I have an interest in and that sparked my own curiosity. I wanna try to bring back the osu! improvement week thing, but that will happen in the summer. I even want to try and begin making videos and stuff, but I don't know how that would work. There are a lot of things that I wanna do, but I can't lie when I say that I am scared to do them. I make this blog post part because I wanted to do so for some time, but also because this week has been **really** difficult for me. I have some things to say and hopefully learn from, but I will try to take them one at a time.

I would like to add comments on the website. I have an Disqus account ready to go, but I would like to try a FOSS alternative. Not sure if such a thing exists, but maybe there is something out there. I will keep searching. For the moment, though. I'm here and I wanna do some stuff as I feel like it will help me out a lot to do them, even if they fail miserably.
