      <description>Hi! For as long as I&amp;rsquo;ve used Linux, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t super popular with mainstream desktop usage, even amongst people that I consider to be nerdy or knowledgeable in this topic. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried many times to bring people over, oftentimes being met with failure. If you don&amp;rsquo;t mind a confession, I used to think that many people who didn&amp;rsquo;t want even try Linux were just&amp;hellip; dumb. Lazy and dumb people, blinded by Windows&amp;rsquo;s and MacOS&amp;rsquo;s marketing.</description>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;ve purchased recently a new mouse: a SteelSeries Rival 3. I had a Logitech G102 mouse before, but it sadly broke. Setting it up was a bit of a challenge, however. I want to show you today how to set it up using two programs: a CLI one for general configuration and a GUI one for the lighting on it. I&amp;rsquo;m doing this post mainly as a reference for setting up most functions of the mice as of November 2022, using Linux native software.</description>
