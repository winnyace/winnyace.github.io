      <description>Hi! Happy New Year! Today, I bring you a little story. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a sad one, at least for me, but I think one that would be interesting. Let&amp;rsquo;s begin!
Last week, I got quite sick. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything too bad, but it was enough to make me not able to go to school and not being able to go to school means that I had a lot of free time on my hands and I had to do something with it.</description>
