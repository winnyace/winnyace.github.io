    </header><p>Hi! This week is a bit disappointing due to serval reasons, but I think it&rsquo;s time to do some retrospective and bring some news to this series.</p>
<p>I will present the scores, first off, in no chronological order. Spoiler alert: only 2 FCs this time. Most scores will be passes.</p>
<p>First up is a score that I wanted since <a href="../osu_i_w_3_4/">week 3&amp;4</a>: Futari no Kimochi no Honto no Himitsu DT FC:</p>

<p>Remember that Flashlight score from <a href="../osu_i_w_5/">last week</a>? Well, I got the FC!</p>

<p>Now, problem is that I was lazy this week. I can&rsquo;t lie to myself when I say that I didn&rsquo;t play as much as I wanted to and for as long, so as a result, the rest of these scores will be passes that I got on maps that I feel are important. The first one to start is on <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/155288#osu/389703">Insane Techniques</a>.</p>
<p><img src="images/image1.png" alt="image1"></p>
<p>The sliders on this map fuck me up hard, not gonna lie, but it&rsquo;s a fun map in my opinion.</p>
<p>Another fun map, or rather song, is <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/306028#osu/705091">ENDLESS QUEER by Renard</a>. The map is a screenjump fest. I enjoy it, though.</p>
<p><img src="images/image2.png" alt="image2"></p>
<p>On the mods side, I got this pass on <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/111760#osu/290581">Diamond</a> with HR. I&rsquo;m hoping next week I will come with a FC on this since it&rsquo;s a pretty average map.</p>
<p><img src="images/image3.png" alt="image3"></p>
<p>Back to NoMod, I got this almost FC on <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/104260#osu/274276">Deep Sea</a></p>
<p><img src="images/image4.png" alt="image4"></p>
<p>I got a score on <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/145978#osu/620789">FAKE PROMISE</a> with HR and NF on, so does it count as a pass? I don&rsquo;t know. I will put in away because I&rsquo;m somewhat proud of it and it&rsquo;s a banging song, not gonna lie.</p>
<p><img src="images/image5.png" alt="image5"></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s about it, to be honest. Not really pleased with the output this week.</p>
<p>Now for some news related to this series. On the 5th of September, I&rsquo;ll start school, my last year of school. At the end of the year, I&rsquo;m going to hold a very important exam here, the baccalaureate. This means that, next week, it is the last week of osu! improvement week, sadly. I&rsquo;m not too sure what I will do this with this series, but I&rsquo;m thinking of doing a monthly series instead. I will cover much more scores and I think it will be a better read than this weekly series. I want to keep playing osu! I don&rsquo;t want to stop just now. It&rsquo;s a fun game and it&rsquo;s deeply fulfilling as well, and so I want to keep going and balance things out.</p>
<p>I still have one goal: FC <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/292077#osu/679779">Asymmetry captin&rsquo;s Extra</a>. I said that I want to get this score I think in week 2 and it&rsquo;s finally time. This last week it&rsquo;s going to be Asymmetry time. I&rsquo;m gonna be like Azer getting his United score, or that&rsquo;s the plan anyway. Speaking of United, I want that score as well, but I first want Asymmetry. I hope I will get it and if I won&rsquo;t get it, well, shit happens and it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>I hope to come back here next week with that score. See ya!</p>
