I’ve enjoyed for the… 10 seconds that it is funny, and then, out of nowhere, I got the title of a song from my childhood in my head: Imaginary Friends by Laszlo, also released by NCS. I suppose, I should explain a bit.\nFor as long as I can remember, I’ve watched YouTube videos. It is, by far, my most visited website on the Internet and represents a huge majority of the content I watch regularly, even today. When I was small, around 10-11, years old, I was extremely into Minecraft and during that era, a lot of what the youtubers I’ve watched were doing Minecraft videos and more specifically Minecraft PVP. And a lot of them used songs from NCS. I remember one youtuber who used that song in the background for one of his survival games series. It was a really beautiful moment when I finally found that song.\nAnd with little song, I remembered a lot of things of my childhood… I’m certainly not 60 years old or anything, but it is still nostalgic for me to remember a time when I was more youthful and innocent. I used to add random people on Skype, yeah Skype, and play Minecraft with them. I used to use a CRT monitor. I used to have a Pentinum 4. I used to make videos on that poor Pentinum 4! Yeah, haha! Search DerFlash on YouTube (it’s in Romanian, but still) and you will find my old attempts at making videos. It is hilariously cringey and corny but man, I was actually trying things back then. That’s something I can’t do it easily. Man… what a time was back then. It’s a time now too, don’t get me wrong, but it’s more weird now… perhaps I’m just more self-aware of my own being than I used to. I certainly need to be more like a kid and just try things, for the sake of trying them. Perhaps that will help me grow as an individual.\nI’ve quite a bit of embarrassing stuff to talk about my past, but that’s for another time, I think.\n",
