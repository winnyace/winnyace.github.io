    </header><p>Hi! This is the second week of my osu! improvement journey some nice things have happened, but it&rsquo;s yet another, sort of, lazy week. Let&rsquo;s begin!</p>
<p>On Monday and Tuesday, I didn&rsquo;t play at all. no excuse, really. Just laziness.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, I played for the first time this week. it was pretty good day I got two HR scores.  Admittedly, they&rsquo;re quite  boring scores, but I think it&rsquo;s a step in the right direction when it comes to HR.  both are done on <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/748836#osu/1577478">Best FriendS by sahuang.</a> What can I say? I like the song :D</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also played a tech, I guess I can call it, map. It&rsquo;s a pretty fine score, I think.</p>

I also got a score on a Non Non Biyori DNB Remix. It&rsquo;s a 54 seconds map, but has CS6 and it&rsquo;s a stream map. I&rsquo;ll take that.</p>

I&rsquo;ve also played a bit of DT on Hidamari Days. Below you&rsquo;ve the score in video form.</p>

<p>Admittedly, these scores aren&rsquo;t something impressive, but I believe it&rsquo;s the step towards the right direction. by this time, I still haven&rsquo;t set a specific goal, however, that changed quickly.</p>
<p>On Thursday, I didn&rsquo;t play yet again.</p>
<p>On Friday, I played for a bit. Nothing much, however. I got a NoMod FC on Rave 2 Rave.</p>

This song is jamming! Not my score, though. My accuracy is quite bad, not gonna lie.</p>
<p>On Saturday is when I finally got a goal: <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/292077#osu/679779">FC Asymmetry by Gaia, captin&rsquo;s Extra difficulty.</a> The map is pretty bog standard these days, I believe, but it&rsquo;s a 6 star map, the song is pretty good, in my opinion, and I think I can get the FC. below you&rsquo;ve the attempt I&rsquo;ve done on Saturday.</p>

<p>You probably saw that I&rsquo;ve a 1000+ combo score on this already.</p>
<p><img src="images/25jul20224.png" alt="image4">
I set that score at beginning of this month. I&rsquo;ve missed at the end, due to the pressure of that FC. This is something I will need to deal with. I panic when I&rsquo;m close to getting a FC. I think everybody does, actually, but some keep their focus and pull through. I think I&rsquo;ll try to regulate my breathing when I&rsquo;m close to getting the FC. I think that&rsquo;s the best solution. Trying to hyperfocus on the map will only result in bad things.</p>
<p>On Sunday, I didn&rsquo;t play.</p>
<p>This ends this week. I kinda want to play osu! right now, believe it or not. See ya next week!</p>
