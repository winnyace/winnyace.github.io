    </header><p>Hi! I come forward to you today with the sad news that I sadly didn&rsquo;t get the Asymmetry score this week. In fact, I&rsquo;m unsatisfied with what I did this week, so I will have a retrospective around this whole thing instead for the end. It felt fitting.</p>
<p>I should, however, at least post what I managed to get in terms of the score, which is a slight improvement over the previous score.</p>
<p><img src="images/image1.png" alt="image1"></p>
<p>I did get other scores, but I&rsquo;m not satisfied with them. I can&rsquo;t lie when I say that during this improvement series, I have been extremely lazy with my play sessions. I didn&rsquo;t try out as many new maps as I wanted and I think that hurt me. I was still lazy when it came to playing the game. A big reason why I&rsquo;ve been this lazy is, I feel like, because of my &lsquo;all or nothing&rsquo; mentality. I can&rsquo;t help but get more and more dissatisfied when I play and I keep failing to do what I set out to do. It&rsquo;s clear to me that this mindset isn&rsquo;t going to be good, long term. I simply have to fail to get good at this game. I can&rsquo;t be good if I don&rsquo;t suck first.</p>
<p>I think for September, I will try to understand what it means to enjoy the game and playing for the sake of enjoyment, becuase if I enjoy playing the game, failing to do something won&rsquo;t be a chore. I don&rsquo;t need to be the best at something to enjoy it. I also want to try lowering my expections for myself. I can&rsquo;t help but think that, while yes, I can get the Asymmetry score, perhaps I&rsquo;ve aimmed slightly too high with this one. I can get it, but I need more time to refine my skills for that. The map is just slightly too much for my level. I need to shoot more close to reality with my skills.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m, however, happy I tried this. I got some decent to good scores out of this and I did something I wanted to do for a long time now, which is this blog. I honestly don&rsquo;t know who read these. I doubt anyone actually read them, fully. I can&rsquo;t help but think I&rsquo;m, more or less, speaking into a void now, talking or rather writing for myself, but then, I don&rsquo;t think I should expect more than that. I&rsquo;m glad, at least, I&rsquo;ve this public record of my existance and that I managed to create this website. Even if nobody read these, I&rsquo;m still happy I did this series and this blog as a whole, to be honest.</p>
<p>I will definitely keep coming here to do my stuff. For the moment, I don&rsquo;t plan to continue this weekly. I plan to talk about my progress when I feel like I&rsquo;ve material for that. I want to talk about other things than osu! too, and I think I just got an idea while writing this sentence that will probably be interesting to talk about. I will see. Until then, see you next time.</p>
