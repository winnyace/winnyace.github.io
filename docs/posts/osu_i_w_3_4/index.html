    </header><p>Towards the beginning of week 3, I got sick and I couldn&rsquo;t really play, which made me feel like these two weeks would be boring, but I got some pretty good scores overall, and I think I&rsquo;m starting to go down the right path. let&rsquo;s begin with week 3. the only score worth noting here is a FC on an, at the time, newly ranked map of a Gochiusa song. it&rsquo;s a pretty bog standard map, but getting it was very rewarding. below you&rsquo;ve the score.</p>

<p>That happened on the 29th of July. Afterwards, nothing really happened. a bad thing I do a lot is giving up on a map after a mistake. that&rsquo;s something that hurts me, a lot, especially mentally. this game is very mental, I feel like. a lot of what I&rsquo;m doing most of the time is fighting myself to keep going and finish the map. always finish the map&hellip; always. I didn&rsquo;t get anything done in that weekend. only thing I got was a new goal: FC <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1567488#osu/">Colorful by L1gHT_u</a>. I got a pretty big combo on it already and I felt I could do it, but I got nothing going.</p>

<p>On Monday, I made the previous blog post and played more Colorful. I still got nothing.</p>

<p>Then on Tuesday, I began playing. It felt like yet another boring slog of a day with more Colorful attempts, until I began playing DT on the ED or OP, I don&rsquo;t really know for sure to be honest, for the Kill me baby anime, at least I think that&rsquo;s the name. I don&rsquo;t really know, all I know is that the song is jamming hard. I began putting some plays into it, going to the end and then&hellip; it happened&hellip;</p>

<p>&hellip;almost&hellip; Yeah&hellip; it was pretty heart breaking. I tried putting another play in, but my electricity cut off and I lost interest by the time it got back on. I knew that I could do it, though, so that became another goal.
For the next few days, nothing happened. I played until I got bored or annoyed, left the game and then went and did something else. That&rsquo;s another problem I feel like I&rsquo;ve: I can&rsquo;t exactly focus on something for a very long period. around the one hour mark is when I get extremely bored and I&rsquo;ve to do something else. I wonder if being constantly online for the past&hellip; almost 10 years at this point, perhaps even more, finally starts getting to me and makes have a lower attention span. I mean, it could be worse. I don&rsquo;t have a TikTok account, but I heard that app reduces attention span at an incredible rate, alongside other nasty side-effects. Admittedly, social media in general does that. I wonder if people actually sit here and read this. If you&rsquo;re reading this: hi, I guess! Anyway, tangent aside, another problem I feel I&rsquo;ve is that I get annoyed, very quickly. I think I said this before in previous post, but I have high expectations of myself when playing, which is quite bad for my mental health, my performance and my equipment as well. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many monitor punches I did when missed that DT score. It&rsquo;s not good going berserk over a game, even if you care a lot about it.</p>
<p>After that DT score, nothing happened. I was thinking to myself what I will show here. I was just playing new things, because I could get anything going in terms of goals, at all. On Friday, however, things took a great turn. The day itself was quite horrible, actually. It was one of those days where you just feel bad and horrible. I felt like even if I don&rsquo;t get anything, I&rsquo;d log in to just have some fun clicking some circles. I had no expectations, at all. And so, I got one of my best days, score wise, in my recent memory It started on a pretty simple map&hellip;</p>

<p>I decided then to just play and I landed on Asymmetry, and I began playing&hellip;</p>

<p>It wasn&rsquo;t a FC, but I&rsquo;m getting closer to it. I took it happily and gratefully. I continued playing, now in a good mood. Nothing really happened until I decided to play Colorful again, with no expectation whatsoever&hellip;</p>
<p><a href="https://odysee.com/$/embed/Colorful-%28Asterisk-DnB-Remix%29--Reunion-FC/52a964a1d2dc2cfb8786935c6c08173fa6251a6e?r=42PNMr5RuN12RUSUC17dRvdcy8EYov9h">Click here for the replay</a><!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<p>To say that this didn&rsquo;t put me in a good mood would be a lie. It made me extremely happy. I played for a bit longer, but I got bored, not gonna lie. It was a fun day that Friday, at the end.
The next day, Saturday, I didn&rsquo;t play at all, which is bad. I was still riding on that happy wave that I got from my FC on Colorful. I might have been able to get a FC on Asymmetry, but alas, it&rsquo;s fine.</p>
<p>On Sunday, so yesterday, it was a pretty slow day, but I manage to get a HR score. The accuracy is pretty meh, but I think the score is overall pretty good.</p>

<p>Overall, these weeks were fine to good, actually. I&rsquo;m really happy I decided to make the two weeks lumped together, because it gave me more time to get some good stuff going. I&rsquo;m not going to do the same with week 5, though, unless something horrible happens, so see ya next week!</p>
