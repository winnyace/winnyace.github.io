    </header><p>Hi! I&rsquo;m currently feeling sad, due to feeling lonely. I think writing here what I feel might help me pass through the feelings, so I&rsquo;m sorry if you&rsquo;re reading expecting something nice.</p>
<p>Actually, who I am kidding? I don&rsquo;t know if anyone even reads this blog. I used to think that it is bad, that I&rsquo;m not cool enough or something, but I&rsquo;m starting to wonder if it is for the best or that it might be a sign that I&rsquo;m just meant to be alone. Even online, I&rsquo;m mostly ignored and stuff, even when I try to talk to people and stuff, but I think I should just accept it. I can&rsquo;t do much more than that, I think.</p>
<p>I admit that I&rsquo;m not really the nicest person. I did manage to more or less kill all of my friend groups due to me being too toxic or needy or what-have-you. I was always somewhat lonely, I guess, and my social skills clearly too little for what I wanted to be at certain ages and stages of my life.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also somewhat shy, especially due to feeling like I will just mess everything up and end up hurting myself even more. Trying to do something social ends up making feel uncomfortable. It&rsquo;s a bit of a miracle, I think, that I managed to make this blog. It&rsquo;s also why I didn&rsquo;t post for a long time, but I think I will actually just use this blog for what it is. Again, I don&rsquo;t think anyone besides me reads this and the occasional person that might come in to check what is up with that link I&rsquo;ve in my Discord bio.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently not sure what to do. I think I should just try to accept my situation and move on with my life, as is. I&rsquo;m not sure how long I would live or what I would be able to achieve, but I think it would best for everyone to just not mix in anyone&rsquo;s way. Yeah, I guess I will I&rsquo;ve said enough. I&rsquo;m sorry, yet again, for anyone who had the displeasure to read this. Currently, a part of me wants to ask you to contact me up, but another just tells me to not do it, so I&rsquo;ll do both at the same time in the form of this sentence you&rsquo;re reading. I will try to come up here often, with something. Again, no one reads this, so I might just use it for my little, sad, not great corner of the web. See ya.</p>
