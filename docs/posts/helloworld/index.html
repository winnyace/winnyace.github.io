I&rsquo;m currently still trying to put everything together for the blog and website. right now, for some reason, the new style isn&rsquo;t being implemented, which is kind of annoying. I had to delete my previous repo for this to work, sadly. it&rsquo;s fine now, though. I&rsquo;m glad how well this turned up to be. now, for the future. I&rsquo;m not too sure what I will do here, but I know I want to do something and hopefully share on my little bit of knowledge I&rsquo;ve and leave my mark on this world, somehow. I&rsquo;ll probably talk about&hellip; whatever goes through my mind at a current time about a topic, really. we&rsquo;ll see. for the time being, though, hello world!</p>
