    </header><p>This week was mostly about getting started with this and trying to enter into a routine. I wanted to play around the same time every single day, but there are a few challenges to that. back in 2020, I used to play around 10-11AM in the morning, for a hour or two, almost every single day. considering I&rsquo;ve other things on my plate nowadays, though, I can&rsquo;t exactly do that, but I think skipping a day or two won&rsquo;t be the end of the world.</p>
<p>another thing I tried to do is to try to keep playing even on a bad day. I&rsquo;ve spent this week mostly derusting and trying to force myself to keep going, no matter what. I believe this is the true challenge of improvement at anything: the mindset you&rsquo;ve towards it. if you want results from the get go, you&rsquo;ll fail to meet them. this happens to me, all the time. I&rsquo;ve very high expectations of myself and I&rsquo;m too impatient with myself as well. real improvement takes time, sometimes a lot of time, and a lot of effort as well  and we can easilyblock progress by being so judgmental over our own performance.  this is something that will take me some time, I believe. it&rsquo;s just something I&rsquo;ve to accept: it will take time to see results. I plan that on bad days to try and play things that I know I can&rsquo;t really play exclusively. since I can&rsquo;t really play such maps, I don&rsquo;t have high expectations of me to do well, so I can impress myself without a ton of work.</p>
<p>for the moment, I don&rsquo;t have very specific goals, but I should get very soon. a problem I&rsquo;ve with goals, however, is how unrealistic I make them. I said once to myself that if I put in the effort to FC <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/536872/#osu/1142960%22">oddloop</a> I can do it. well, yes, that&rsquo;s true, but it&rsquo;s a very difficult map for me currently, especially the ending. the map requires a lot of precise aim, something I&rsquo;m currently trying to get back and continue working on, as well as reading. my goals have to be something I can reasonably do. I&rsquo;ll see what will be able to come up with and I will share them here.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m gonna be honest: I didn&rsquo;t exactly put much effort this week into this. I&rsquo;m trying to figure out how to make this as well. I think I will take notes during the play session, so for each day there&rsquo;s something more concrete,  not just this vagueness I did this week. I also want to post the scores I believe to be good to great as well and maybe try to narrate these little blogs and make a little video each week for them. I will think about it. if you&rsquo;ve an idea or you just want to give me feedback, you can always find my contact information on this blog. I&rsquo;m most active on Discord.</p>
<p>that&rsquo;s for the moment. thanks for reading!</p>
