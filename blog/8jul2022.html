				big part of my teenage life was discovering and playing osu!, a
				pretty popular rhythm game. i’ve been playing since june of 2016
				and ever since then, i wanted to be a good player. due to laziness,
				lack of motivation and other similar things, in my 6 years of playing
				this game, i didn’t get extremely far, but i keep on trying to both
				improve and have fun. </font></font></font>
				</p>
				<p><font face="Ubuntu"><font size="4" style="font-size: 15pt">	in
				the summer of 2020, i was playing this game quite a lot, to the point
				where i was doing things that were previously impossible for me. i
				felt really good about that time and i want to redo it and also
				document the entire process. </font></font>
				</p>
				<p><font face="Ubuntu"><font size="4" style="font-size: 15pt">	as
				the title suggests, i'm going to do these weekly, ideally. i will
				talk about the scores i have set in that week, some stuff outside the
				game but still related somewhat, my thoughts on different things, and
				other things that i find important to share. my main goal with this
				week series is start doing those amazing things again, while also
				sharing on some of my knowledge that i have gained and i will gain
				with this. i hope it will be fun. if you guys have suggestions,
				here's my contact information.</font></font></p>

				to some great circle clicking! ^o^</font></font></p>
