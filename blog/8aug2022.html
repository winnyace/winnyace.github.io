            <h1>osu! improvement week 3 and 4</h1>
            <br/>
            <p>towards the beginning of week 3, I got sick and I couldn't really
            play, which made me feel like these two weeks would be boring, but I
            got some pretty good scores overall, and I think I'm starting to go
            down the right path.</p>
            <p>let's begin with week 3. the only score worth noting here is a FC
            on an, at the time, newly ranked map of a Gochiusa song. it's a
            pretty bog standard map, but getting it was very rewarding. below
            you've the score.</p>

            <p>that happened on the 29th of July. afterwards, nothing really
            happened. a bad thing I do a lot is giving up on a map after a
            mistake. that's something that hurts me, a lot, especially mentally.
            this game is very mental, I feel like. a lot of what I'm doing most
            of the time is fighting myself to keep going and finish the map.
            <b>always finish the map... always</b>.</p>
            <p>I didn't get anything done in that weekend. only thing I got was a
            new goal: FC <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/1567488#osu/3200539" target="_blank">Colorful by L1gHT_u</a>. 
            I got a pretty big combo on it
            already and I felt I could do it, but I got nothing going. 
            </p>

            <p>On Monday, I made the previous blog post and played more Colorful. I still got nothing.</p>

            <p>insert video here.</p>

            <p>Then on Tuesday, I began playing. It felt like yet another boring
            slog of a day with more Colorful attempts, until I began playing DT
            on the ED or OP, I don't really know for sure to be honest, for the
            Kill me baby anime, at least I think that's the name. I don't really
            know, all I know is that the song is jamming hard. I began putting
            some plays into it, going to the end and then... it happened... 
            </p>

            <p>insert video here.</p>

            <p>...almost... Yeah... it was pretty heart breaking. I tried putting
            another play in, but my electricity cut off and I lost interest by
            the time it got back on. I knew that I could do it, though, so that
            became another goal. 
            </p>

            <p>For the next few days, nothing happened. I played until I got
            bored or annoyed, left the game and then went and did something else.
            That's another problem I feel like I've: I can't exactly focus on
            something for a very long period. around the one hour mark is when I
            get extremely bored and I've to do something else. I wonder if being
            constantly online for the past... almost 10 years at this point,
            perhaps even more, finally starts getting to me and makes have a
            lower attention span. I mean, it could be worse. I don't have a
            TikTok account, but I heard that app reduces attention span at an
            incredible rate, alongside other nasty side-effects. Admittedly,
            social media in general does that. I wonder if people actually sit
            here and read this. If you're reading this: hi, I guess!</p>
            <p>Anyway, tangent aside, another problem I feel I've is that I get
            annoyed, very quickly. I think I said this before in previous post,
            but I have high expectations of myself when playing, which is quite
            bad for my mental health, my performance and my equipment as well. I
            can't tell you how many monitor punches I did when missed that DT
            score. <b>It's not good going berserk over a game, even if you
                care a lot about it.</b></p>
            <p>After that DT score, nothing
            happened. I was thinking to myself what I will show here. I was just
            playing new things, because I could get anything going in terms of
            goals, at all. On Friday, however, things took a great turn. The day
            itself was quite horrible, actually. It was one of those days where
            you just feel bad and horrible. I felt like even if I don't get
            anything, I'd log in to just have some fun clicking some circles. I
            had no expectations, at all. And so, I got one of my best days, score
            wise, in my recent memory.<p>
            <p>It started on a pretty simple map...</p>

            <p>I decided then to just play and I
            landed on Asymmetry, and I began playing...</p>

            <p>insert video here</p>

            <p>It wasn't a FC, but I'm getting closer
            to it. I took it happily and gratefully. I continued playing, now in
            a good mood. Nothing really happened until I decided to play Colorful
            again, with no expectation whatsoever...</p>

            <p>insert video here.</p>

            <p>To say that this didn't put me in a
            good mood would be a lie. It made me extremely happy. I played for a
            bit longer, but I got bored, not gonna lie. It was a fun day that
            Friday, at the end.</p>
            <p>The next day, Saturday, I didn't play
            at all, which is bad. I was still riding on that happy wave that I
            got from my FC on Colorful. I might have been able to get a FC on
            Asymmetry, but alas, it's fine.<p>
            <p>On Sunday, so yesterday, it was a
            pretty slow day, but I manage to get a HR score. The accuracy is
            pretty meh, but I think the score is overall pretty good.</p>

            <p>insert video here</p>

            <p>Overall, these weeks were fine to
            good, actually. I'm really happy I decided to make the two weeks
            lumped together, because it gave me more time to get some good stuff
            going. I'm not going to do the same with week 5, though, unless
            something horrible happens, so see ya next week!</p>
