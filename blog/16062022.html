			<p><font face="Ubuntu" style="font-size: 15pt"> I was at my computer, like I
			always am. Just finished my cycling session and I was really bored,
			and I saw a Vtuber meme which had a low quality version of Candyland
			by Tobu, released by NCS, I think(?). Out of my boredom, I decided to
			actually search for the meme. I’ve enjoyed for the… 10 seconds
			that it is funny, and then, out of nowhere, I got the title of a song
			from my childhood in my head: Imaginary Friends by Laszlo, also
			released by NCS.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Ubuntu" style="font-size: 15pt">	I suppose, I should explain a bit. For as
			long as I can remember, I’ve watched YouTube videos. It is, by far,
			my most visited website on the Internet and represents a huge
			majority of the content I watch regularly, even today. When I was
			small, around 10-11, years old, I was extremely into Minecraft and
			during that era, a lot of what the youtubers I’ve watched were
			doing Minecraft videos and more specifically Minecraft PVP. And a lot
			of them used songs from NCS. I remember one youtuber who used that
			song in the background for one of his survival games series. It was a
			really beautiful moment when I finally found that song. </font>
			</p>
			<p><font face="Ubuntu" style="font-size: 15pt">	And with little song, I remembered a lot of
			things of my childhood... I’m certainly not 60 years old or
			anything, but it is still nostalgic for me to remember a time when I
			was more youthful and innocent. I used to add random people on Skype,
			yeah Skype, and play Minecraft with them. I used to use a CRT
			monitor. I used to have a Pentinum 4. I used to make videos on that
			poor Pentinum 4! Yeah, haha! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/KillerGamingOldschoolGaming" target="_blank">Search
			DerFlash on YouTube</a>(it’s in Romanian, but still) and you will
			find my old attempts at making videos. It is hilariously cringey and
			corny but man, I was actually trying things back then. That’s
			something I can’t do it easily. Man… what a time was back then.
			It’s a time now too, don’t get me wrong, but it’s more weird
			now… perhaps I’m just more self-aware of my own being than I used
			to. I certainly need to be more like a kid and just try things, for
			the sake of trying them. Perhaps that will help me grow as an
			individual.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Ubuntu" style="font-size: 15pt">	I’ve quite a bit of embarrassing stuff to
			talk about my past, but that’s for another time, I think.</font></p>
