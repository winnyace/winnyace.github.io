			<h1>osu! improvement week 2</h1>
			<br/>

			<p>hi! this is the second week of my osu! improvement journey some nice things have happened, but it's yet another, 
			sort of, lazy week. let's begin!</p>
			<br/>

			<p>on Monday and Tuesday, I didn't play at all. no excuse, really. just laziness.</p>
			<br/>

			<p>	on Wednesday, I played for the first time this week. it was pretty good day I got two HR scores. 
			admittedly, they're quite boring scores, but I think it's a step in the right direction when it comes to HR. 
			both are done on <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/748836#osu/1577478" target="_blank">Best FriendS by sahuang.</a> 
			what can I say? I like the song :D</p>
			<p>below are the two scores	in video form.</p>

			<p>I've also played a tech, I guess I can call it, map. it's a pretty fine score, I think.</p>
			<p><img src="25jul2022_html_636aa49dc5509763.png" name="Image1" width="665" height="374">
			
			<p>also got a score on a Non Non Biyori DNB Remix. it's a 54 seconds map, but has CS6 and it's a stream map. I'll take that.</p>

			<p>I've also played a bit of DT	on Hidamari Days. below you've the score in video form.</p>
			
			<iframe id="odysee-iframe" width="560" height="315" src="https://odysee.com/$/embed/Hidamari-Days-DT/13d54fe68d3bab94edac8d628c7d47c4506e7adc?r=42PNMr5RuN12RUSUC17dRvdcy8EYov9h" allowfullscreen></iframe>

			<p>admittedly, these scores aren't
			something impressive, but I believe it's the step towards the right
			direction. by this time, I still haven't set a specific goal,
			however, that changed quickly.</p>
			<br/>

			<p>	On Thursday, I didn't play yet again.</p>
			<br/>

			<p>	On Friday, I played for a bit. nothing much, however. I got a NoMod FC on Rave 2 Rave.</p>
			<img src="25jul2022_html_5296ffc27a39c824.png" name="Image3" width="665" height="374">
			<p>This song is jamming! Not my score, though. My accuracy is quite bad, not gonna lie.</p>
			<br/>
			
			<p>	On Saturday is when I finally got a goal: <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/292077#osu/679779" target="_blank">FC Asymmetry by Gaia, captin's Extra difficulty.</a> 
			The map is pretty bog standard these days, I believe, but it's a 6 star map, the song is pretty good, in my opinion, 
			and I think I can get the FC. below you've the attempt I've done on Saturday.</p>
			
			<iframe id="odysee-iframe" width="560" height="315" src="https://odysee.com/$/embed/Asymmetry-captin%27s-Extra--pass/c11bbdd290fbd9aef9726bca4b7c36000bbb7213?r=42PNMr5RuN12RUSUC17dRvdcy8EYov9h" allowfullscreen></iframe>			

			<p>you probably saw that I've a 1000+ combo score on this already.</p>
			<img src="25jul2022_html_16803e2cb59aceef.png" name="Image4" width="665" height="374">

			<p>I set that score at beginning of this month. I've missed at the end, due to the pressure of that FC. 
			this is something I will need to deal with. I panic when I'm close to getting a FC. I think everybody does, actually, 
			but some keep their focus and pull through. I think I'll try to regulate my breathing when I'm close to 
			getting the FC. I think that's the best solution. Trying to hyperfocus on the map will only result in bad things.</p>
			<br/>

			<p>On Sunday, I didn't play.</p>
			<br/>

			<p>This ends this week. I kinda want to play osu! right now, believe it or not. See ya next week!</p>
