# Winny's Personal Website
this is my personal website/blog that I've made. GitHub pages is painfully slow, so if something doesn't, it's probably just GitHub lacking behind.

It's developed using Hugo now. The old design of the blog can be found under the old_design folder. not sure if everything will work, to be honest with you, though.
