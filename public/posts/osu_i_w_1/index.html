I’ve very high expectations of myself and I’m too impatient with myself as well. real improvement takes time, sometimes a lot of time, and a lot of effort as well and we can easilyblock progress by being so judgmental over our own performance. this is something that will take me some time, I believe. it’s just something I’ve to accept: it will take time to see results.

I said once to myself that if I put in the effort to FC oddloop I can do it. well, yes, that’s true, but it’s a very difficult map for me currently, especially the ending. the map requires a lot of precise aim, something I’m currently trying to get back and continue working on, as well as reading. my goals have to be something I can reasonably do. I’ll see what will be able to come up with and I will share them here.\nI’m gonna be honest: I didn’t exactly put much effort this week into this. I’m trying to figure out how to make this as well. I think I will take notes during the play session, so for each day there’s something more concrete, not just this vagueness I did this week. I also want to post the scores I believe to be good to great as well and maybe try to narrate these little blogs and make a little video each week for them. I will think about it. if you’ve an idea or you just want to give me feedback, you can always find my contact information on this blog. I’m most active on Discord.\nthat’s for the moment. thanks for reading!\n",
