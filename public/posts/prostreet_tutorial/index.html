  <div class="post-content"><p>Hi! Over the summer, I&rsquo;ve gotten the Need for Speed itch. Thus, I&rsquo;ve decided to play a title I have never finished: ProStreet. Getting to work on Linux was a bit of a challenge, however. I hope this post will help you run the game. It worked for me under openSUSE Tumbleweed, with Wine version 9.16 .</p>
<p>The first thing you need is the game. The game isn&rsquo;t available for purchase anymore, unless you buy second hand, so pirating is possible. I personally recommend just pirating the game. Here&rsquo;s <a href="https://pixeldrain.com/u/maXwYgoi">a link</a> to an archive of the game. It will have the game with the latest official patch, which is still a bit broken.</p>
<p>Next, we will need a special .exe file for the game. Here&rsquo;s <a href="https://g06.mobiletarget.net/?y=4f95b43f&amp;x=%2FuICh%2FSHYIusoj2por6XBj85TS0CEeI%2Br0nLW8JXALPAAwCSBFxoN5N11CHniB7sAg%2BZ%2FLqcjP3zS6bv9%2BfLyJvfzN9WO8iTSWOqHxvWEe5ozbsjKUChiXKvTSKBOXdS">a link</a> for that special .exe file as well. Just replace the .exe from the game folder with the one from the provided archive.</p>
<p>Afterwards, it is time to set up our prefix. You would need <code>winetricks</code> installed for this step and obviously Wine. I won&rsquo;t be going over this step, since there are already plenty of tutorials for doing that. To generate the prefix, type in a terminal <code>WINEPREFIX=/path/to/your/prefix WINEARCH=win32 winecfg</code>. It will open up the config program for Wine. Now it is time to install the required stuff for the game to work. Type in a terminal <code>WINEPREFIX=/path/to/your/prefix WINEARCH=win32 winetricks d3dx9_34 dxvk</code>. This will be enough to play the game, without community fixes.</p>
<p>I recommend you do install community fixes, however. The one I used was <a href="https://github.com/ThirteenAG/WidescreenFixesPack/releases/tag/nfsps">ThirteenAG&rsquo;s ProStreet Generic Fix</a>. Just download it and replace the files from the game folder with the ones from the archive. After that, open <code>winecfg</code> in your prefix, go to the Libraries, and in dropdown box, type <code>dinput8</code> and click Add.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s it! You can now launch the game by going in the game folder, pointing to your prefix and launching the game exe. Enjoy!</p>
<p>Recommendation for complete newbies:</p>
<ul>
<li>For the prefix path, I recommend <code>/home/&lt;your_username&gt;/.local/share/wineprefixes/nfsps</code>. The folder wineprefixes doesn&rsquo;t exist by default. You can create it with the terminal by typing <code>mkdir $HOME/.local/share/wineprefixes</code>.</li>
