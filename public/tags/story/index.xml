      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! Happy New Year! Today, I bring you a little story. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a sad one, at least for me, but I think one that would be interesting. Let&amp;rsquo;s begin!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, I got quite sick. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything too bad, but it was enough to make me not able to go to school and not being able to go to school means that I had a lot of free time on my hands and I had to do something with it. This is where a little laptop imported from Germany comes in. This laptop was brought by dad, from one of his colleagues at work. It is a Vista era machine by Acer, an Aspire 5315 to be exact, with a ground-breaking and absolutely monstrous Intel Celeron with a whopping 2GB of RAM on board, with a max of 2GB of RAM on board!! Absolutely fantastic&amp;hellip; fantastically bad, I think for the time and especially now. It was enough to get you by then, doing simple tasks. When it reached my hands, it had Windows 7 on it, but the OS was broken beyond repair. It also had a very noisy fan, but it was very charming. The bulkyness of it and the fact it had marker written letters on the keyboard, since it had the german layout written on it, it simply won me over. I found it adorable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
