      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! I&amp;rsquo;ve purchased recently a new mouse: a SteelSeries Rival 3. I had a Logitech G102 mouse before, but it sadly broke. Setting it up was a bit of a challenge, however. I want to show you today how to set it up using two programs: a CLI one for general configuration and a GUI one for the lighting on it.
I&amp;rsquo;m doing this post mainly as a reference for setting up most functions of the mice as of November 2022, using Linux native software. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if the SteelSeries software thing works under Wine or not and to be honest I don&amp;rsquo;t really want to try either. Most likely, in the future, this information will be out-of-date. &lt;strong&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t a review of the mice. This is just for setting it up for what I think is normal use.&lt;/strong&gt; If you want a super quick opinion on it, though, it is great and works very well. With all of that out of the way, let&amp;rsquo;s get into setting this puppy up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
