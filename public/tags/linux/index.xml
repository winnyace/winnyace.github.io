      <title>How to play Need for Speed ProStreet on Linux</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! Over the summer, I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten the Need for Speed itch. Thus, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to play a title I have never finished: ProStreet. Getting to work on Linux was a bit of a challenge, however. I hope this post will help you run the game. It worked for me under openSUSE Tumbleweed, with Wine version 9.16 .&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you need is the game. The game isn&amp;rsquo;t available for purchase anymore, unless you buy second hand, so pirating is possible. I personally recommend just pirating the game. Here&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://pixeldrain.com/u/maXwYgoi&#34;&gt;a link&lt;/a&gt; to an archive of the game. It will have the game with the latest official patch, which is still a bit broken.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;disclaimer&#34;&gt;DISCLAIMER&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hi! It&amp;rsquo;s winny from the future. This article is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very old;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Potentially incorrect in the Debian section entirely!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I decided to leave this article up for the sake of historical purposes, but this issue has been fixed, I believe, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=220436&#34;&gt;since the introduction of the 64-bit client for Team Fortress 2, almost a year ago.&lt;/a&gt; As such, please don&amp;rsquo;t use this article. If you have issues with something regarding Team Fortress 2 and Linux, check &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.protondb.com/app/440&#34;&gt;TF2&amp;rsquo;s ProtonDB page.&lt;/a&gt; Thank you!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What is, in my opinion, the reason why Linux isn&#39;t popular for normal desktop use?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! For as long as I&amp;rsquo;ve used Linux, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t super popular with mainstream desktop usage, even amongst people that I consider to be nerdy or knowledgeable in this topic. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried many times to bring people over, oftentimes being met with failure. If you don&amp;rsquo;t mind a confession, I used to think that many people who didn&amp;rsquo;t want even try Linux were just&amp;hellip; dumb. Lazy and dumb people, blinded by Windows&amp;rsquo;s and MacOS&amp;rsquo;s marketing. &amp;ldquo;Why can&amp;rsquo;t they see this as the better OS?&amp;rdquo; is what I said to myself oftentimes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>SteelSeries Rival 3: Linux config mini-guide</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! I&amp;rsquo;ve purchased recently a new mouse: a SteelSeries Rival 3. I had a Logitech G102 mouse before, but it sadly broke. Setting it up was a bit of a challenge, however. I want to show you today how to set it up using two programs: a CLI one for general configuration and a GUI one for the lighting on it.
I&amp;rsquo;m doing this post mainly as a reference for setting up most functions of the mice as of November 2022, using Linux native software. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if the SteelSeries software thing works under Wine or not and to be honest I don&amp;rsquo;t really want to try either. Most likely, in the future, this information will be out-of-date. &lt;strong&gt;This isn&amp;rsquo;t a review of the mice. This is just for setting it up for what I think is normal use.&lt;/strong&gt; If you want a super quick opinion on it, though, it is great and works very well. With all of that out of the way, let&amp;rsquo;s get into setting this puppy up.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
