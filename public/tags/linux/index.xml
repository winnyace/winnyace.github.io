      <description>Hi! Over the summer, I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten the Need for Speed itch. Thus, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to play a title I have never finished: ProStreet. Getting to work on Linux was a bit of a challenge, however. I hope this post will help you run the game. It worked for me under openSUSE Tumbleweed, with Wine version 9.16 .
The first thing you need is the game. The game isn&amp;rsquo;t available for purchase anymore, unless you buy second hand, so pirating is possible.</description>

      <description>DISCLAIMER Hi! It&amp;rsquo;s winny from the future. This article is:
Very old; Potentially incorrect in the Debian section entirely! I decided to leave this article up for the sake of historical purposes, but this issue has been fixed, I believe, since the introduction of the 64-bit client for Team Fortress 2, almost a year ago. As such, please don&amp;rsquo;t use this article. If you have issues with something regarding Team Fortress 2 and Linux, check TF2&amp;rsquo;s ProtonDB page.</description>

      <title>What is, in my opinion, the reason why Linux isn&#39;t popular for normal desktop use?</title>

      <description>Hi! For as long as I&amp;rsquo;ve used Linux, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t super popular with mainstream desktop usage, even amongst people that I consider to be nerdy or knowledgeable in this topic. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried many times to bring people over, oftentimes being met with failure. If you don&amp;rsquo;t mind a confession, I used to think that many people who didn&amp;rsquo;t want even try Linux were just&amp;hellip; dumb. Lazy and dumb people, blinded by Windows&amp;rsquo;s and MacOS&amp;rsquo;s marketing.</description>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;ve purchased recently a new mouse: a SteelSeries Rival 3. I had a Logitech G102 mouse before, but it sadly broke. Setting it up was a bit of a challenge, however. I want to show you today how to set it up using two programs: a CLI one for general configuration and a GUI one for the lighting on it. I&amp;rsquo;m doing this post mainly as a reference for setting up most functions of the mice as of November 2022, using Linux native software.</description>
