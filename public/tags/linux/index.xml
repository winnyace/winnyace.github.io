      <description>Hi! Over the summer, I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten the Need for Speed itch. Thus, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to play a title I have never finished: ProStreet. Getting to work on Linux was a bit of a challenge, however. I hope this post will help you run the game. It worked for me under openSUSE Tumbleweed, with Wine version 9.16 .
The first thing you need is the game. The game isn&amp;rsquo;t available for purchase anymore, unless you buy second hand, so pirating is possible.</description>

      <description>Hi! I like playing TF2. It&amp;rsquo;s a fun game, even if Valve doesn&amp;rsquo;t really give a shit about it. Problem is that I haven&amp;rsquo;t played in quite some time and I wanted to play it recently. Sadly, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t due to a new update that introduced a bug, I think. I would tell you more if I knew more. All I know is the fix for this issue, that I found on ProtonDB&amp;rsquo;s page for TF2.</description>

      <title>What is, in my opinion, the reason why Linux isn&#39;t popular for normal desktop use?</title>

      <description>Hi! For as long as I&amp;rsquo;ve used Linux, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t super popular with mainstream desktop usage, even amongst people that I consider to be nerdy or knowledgeable in this topic. I&amp;rsquo;ve tried many times to bring people over, oftentimes being met with failure. If you don&amp;rsquo;t mind a confession, I used to think that many people who didn&amp;rsquo;t want even try Linux were just&amp;hellip; dumb. Lazy and dumb people, blinded by Windows&amp;rsquo;s and MacOS&amp;rsquo;s marketing.</description>

      <title>SteelSeries Rival 3: Linux config mini-guide</title>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;ve purchased recently a new mouse: a SteelSeries Rival 3. I had a Logitech G102 mouse before, but it sadly broke. Setting it up was a bit of a challenge, however. I want to show you today how to set it up using two programs: a CLI one for general configuration and a GUI one for the lighting on it. I&amp;rsquo;m doing this post mainly as a reference for setting up most functions of the mice as of November 2022, using Linux native software.</description>
