      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! Long time no see.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have you ever struggled with motivation? Because I do, all the time. It is a pain in the butt. Especially when you&amp;rsquo;re bored and you wonder what you could do to not be bored, like me right now, or when you have an important exam coming up and you just can&amp;rsquo;t be arsed to do anything for it. This is the situation I am in right now.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yo! Long time no see. I have began university, at computer science. Things have been mixed, but mostly well. I kinda just want to do a post to say that I&amp;rsquo;m here and I want to do stuff here. Not sure what, but I know want to do stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanna try to do blog posts that talk about random stuff, either in my life or online that I have an interest in and that sparked my own curiosity. I wanna try to bring back the osu! improvement week thing, but that will happen in the summer. I even want to try and begin making videos and stuff, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know how that would work. There are a lot of things that I wanna do, but I can&amp;rsquo;t lie when I say that I am scared to do them. I make this blog post part because I wanted to do so for some time, but also because this week has been &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; difficult for me. I have some things to say and hopefully learn from, but I will try to take them one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! Well, some people, if there is someone reading this blog, knows that I&amp;rsquo;ve posted something similar to this a few months ago. I&amp;rsquo;ve removed that post due to some trolls coming on a Discord server I was in. They saw my blog and that post and began to do what a troll does best: troll. I&amp;rsquo;m going to hope something like that doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen again. I know this isn&amp;rsquo;t the usual stuff I talk about here, but it&amp;rsquo;s my blog and I will just talk about whatever interests me at the time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Some changes to my configuration</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/new_config_stuff/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! I&amp;rsquo;ve realized that, since my last configuration post, things have changed, quite a bit. I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk about them and some of the things that I still haven&amp;rsquo;t ironed out yet. Let&amp;rsquo;s begin!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, my desktop environment: for a long time, I&amp;rsquo;ve used XFCE4 as my main DE.
I&amp;rsquo;ve tried window managers like stock Openbox before, or desktop environments like GNOME or Cinnamon, but currently, KDE Plasma is the destkop environment I use.
XFCE still has a soft spot in my heart, but currently, Plasma is the best in-between for me.
It has the fast performance when I want that and nice animations and eye candy when I want that.
It has every feature I want/need and I think it&amp;rsquo;s more feature rich than XFCE. Some might say too feature rich, but I somewhat like that.
I don&amp;rsquo;t think it is as polished as GNOME, for example the calculator apps (yes, apps, because KDE seems to have separated different types of calculators in different apps) are lacking compared to GMOME&amp;rsquo;s calculator, but Plasma doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel as restricted as GNOME, which is something I really like.
I would like to revisit GNOME some time later this year and lay down everything I like and don&amp;rsquo;t about it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>A little story of an old laptop and Linux</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/linux_laptop_story/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! Happy New Year! Today, I bring you a little story. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a sad one, at least for me, but I think one that would be interesting. Let&amp;rsquo;s begin!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last week, I got quite sick. It wasn&amp;rsquo;t anything too bad, but it was enough to make me not able to go to school and not being able to go to school means that I had a lot of free time on my hands and I had to do something with it. This is where a little laptop imported from Germany comes in. This laptop was brought by dad, from one of his colleagues at work. It is a Vista era machine by Acer, an Aspire 5315 to be exact, with a ground-breaking and absolutely monstrous Intel Celeron with a whopping 2GB of RAM on board, with a max of 2GB of RAM on board!! Absolutely fantastic&amp;hellip; fantastically bad, I think for the time and especially now. It was enough to get you by then, doing simple tasks. When it reached my hands, it had Windows 7 on it, but the OS was broken beyond repair. It also had a very noisy fan, but it was very charming. The bulkyness of it and the fact it had marker written letters on the keyboard, since it had the german layout written on it, it simply won me over. I found it adorable.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>My configuration and stuff</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/configuration_and_stuff/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few months ago, I put my configuration files in a GitHub repo, something I should have done as soon as I learnt how Git works, but alas. Today, I&amp;rsquo;m going to tell you why things are the way they&amp;rsquo;re there and also I hope to give some opinions on some things related to configuration. Let&amp;rsquo;s begin!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I go into them, I want to get out some basic things out of the way. &lt;strong&gt;I use Arch Linux.&lt;/strong&gt; I know, first thing I say in this blog post related to my setup is my OS, Arch. I get it, but &lt;em&gt;why do I use Arch?&lt;/em&gt; Because my computer is sort of my center of activity. Let me explain: my uses for a computer are both to entertain myself, but also to work. I use my computer for practically everything I do on a day to day basis. I play games, I study here, I do quite a lot of things. You might think that Windows might be better at this job, because it has a wider support. The problem is that I dislike Windows and how things are done, so I&amp;rsquo;d rather deal with Linux than go through the nightmare that is Windows for me. I do have a Windows 10 install, but I barely use it and I use it mainly to play games hassle free.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Nostalgia</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I was at my computer, like I always am. Just finished my cycling session and I was really bored, and I saw a Vtuber meme which had a low quality version of Candyland by Tobu, released by NCS, I think(?). Out of my boredom, I decided to actually search for the meme. I’ve enjoyed for the… 10 seconds that it is funny, and then, out of nowhere, I got the title of a song from my childhood in my head: Imaginary Friends by Laszlo, also released by NCS. I suppose, I should explain a bit.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
