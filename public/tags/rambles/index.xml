      <description>Hi! Long time no see.
Have you ever struggled with motivation? Because I do, all the time. It is a pain in the butt. Especially when you&amp;rsquo;re bored and you wonder what you could do to not be bored, like me right now, or when you have an important exam coming up and you just can&amp;rsquo;t be arsed to do anything for it. This is the situation I am in right now.</description>

      <description>Yo! Long time no see. I have began university, at computer science. Things have been mixed, but mostly well. I kinda just want to do a post to say that I&amp;rsquo;m here and I want to do stuff here. Not sure what, but I know want to do stuff.
I wanna try to do blog posts that talk about random stuff, either in my life or online that I have an interest in and that sparked my own curiosity.</description>

      <description>I was at my computer, like I always am. Just finished my cycling session and I was really bored, and I saw a Vtuber meme which had a low quality version of Candyland by Tobu, released by NCS, I think(?). Out of my boredom, I decided to actually search for the meme. I’ve enjoyed for the… 10 seconds that it is funny, and then, out of nowhere, I got the title of a song from my childhood in my head: Imaginary Friends by Laszlo, also released by NCS.</description>
