      <description>Hi! I like playing TF2. It&amp;rsquo;s a fun game, even if Valve doesn&amp;rsquo;t really give a shit about it. Problem is that I haven&amp;rsquo;t played in quite some time and I wanted to play it recently. Sadly, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t due to a new update that introduced a bug, I think. I would tell you more if I knew more. All I know is the fix for this issue, that I found on ProtonDB&amp;rsquo;s page for TF2.</description>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;ve purchased recently a new mouse: a SteelSeries Rival 3. I had a Logitech G102 mouse before, but it sadly broke. Setting it up was a bit of a challenge, however. I want to show you today how to set it up using two programs: a CLI one for general configuration and a GUI one for the lighting on it. I&amp;rsquo;m doing this post mainly as a reference for setting up most functions of the mice as of November 2022, using Linux native software.</description>
