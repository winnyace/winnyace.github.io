      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! I come forward to you today with the sad news that I sadly didn&amp;rsquo;t get the Asymmetry score this week. In fact, I&amp;rsquo;m unsatisfied with what I did this week, so I will have a retrospective around this whole thing instead for the end. It felt fitting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should, however, at least post what I managed to get in terms of the score, which is a slight improvement over the previous score.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! This week is a bit disappointing due to serval reasons, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s time to do some retrospective and bring some news to this series.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will present the scores, first off, in no chronological order. Spoiler alert: only 2 FCs this time. Most scores will be passes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First up is a score that I wanted since &lt;a href=&#34;../osu_i_w_3_4/&#34;&gt;week 3&amp;amp;4&lt;/a&gt;: Futari no Kimochi no Honto no Himitsu DT FC:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div style=&#34;position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;&#34;&gt;
      &lt;iframe allow=&#34;accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share&#34; allowfullscreen=&#34;allowfullscreen&#34; loading=&#34;eager&#34; referrerpolicy=&#34;strict-origin-when-cross-origin&#34; src=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qc8n4j_mCzk?autoplay=0&amp;amp;controls=1&amp;amp;end=0&amp;amp;loop=0&amp;amp;mute=0&amp;amp;start=0&#34; style=&#34;position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; border:0;&#34; title=&#34;YouTube video&#34;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remember that Flashlight score from &lt;a href=&#34;../osu_i_w_5/&#34;&gt;last week&lt;/a&gt;? Well, I got the FC!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! I kinda missed the mark, not gonna lie. I want from now on to post these weekly updates on Sunday. This week is missed, but next one, it will be from today to Sunday next week. I’ll try to keep my promise. Anyway, with that aside, this week was another mostly lazy one, but I got some pretty good scores. Let’s begin!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After my post from last week, I didn’t play until Thursday. That isn’t very good, but yeah… I started to play on Wednesday and I got two scores that I’m quite proud of. The first one is a slightly weird jump map, &lt;a href=&#34;https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/962568#osu/2015483&#34;&gt;Futari Dake no Kotoba&lt;/a&gt;. I’m not sure if these jumps are called anti-jumps or not, but I think they’re.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Towards the beginning of week 3, I got sick and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t really play, which made me feel like these two weeks would be boring, but I got some pretty good scores overall, and I think I&amp;rsquo;m starting to go down the right path. let&amp;rsquo;s begin with week 3. the only score worth noting here is a FC on an, at the time, newly ranked map of a Gochiusa song. it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty bog standard map, but getting it was very rewarding. below you&amp;rsquo;ve the score.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi. Due to me getting slightly sick and also not enough scores to show, I decided to not do this week and I&amp;rsquo;ll lump week 3 and 4 into one. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry for the inconvenience and I hope that I&amp;rsquo;ll show some good stuff next week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi! This is the second week of my osu! improvement journey some nice things have happened, but it&amp;rsquo;s yet another, sort of, lazy week. Let&amp;rsquo;s begin!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Monday and Tuesday, I didn&amp;rsquo;t play at all. no excuse, really. Just laziness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, I played for the first time this week. it was pretty good day I got two HR scores.  Admittedly, they&amp;rsquo;re quite  boring scores, but I think it&amp;rsquo;s a step in the right direction when it comes to HR.  both are done on &lt;a href=&#34;https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmapsets/748836#osu/1577478&#34;&gt;Best FriendS by sahuang.&lt;/a&gt; What can I say? I like the song :D&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week was mostly about getting started with this and trying to enter into a routine. I wanted to play around the same time every single day, but there are a few challenges to that. back in 2020, I used to play around 10-11AM in the morning, for a hour or two, almost every single day. considering I&amp;rsquo;ve other things on my plate nowadays, though, I can&amp;rsquo;t exactly do that, but I think skipping a day or two won&amp;rsquo;t be the end of the world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A big part of my teenage life was discovering and playing osu!, a pretty popular rhythm game. I’ve been playing since June of 2016 and ever since then, I wanted to be a good player. Due to laziness, lack of motivation and other similar things, in my 6 years of playing this game, I didn’t get extremely far, but I keep on trying to both improve and have fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the summer of 2020, I was playing this game quite a lot, to the point where I was doing things that were previously impossible for me. I felt really good about that time and I want to redo it and also document the entire process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
