      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi all! I have said in my most recent blog post that I want to add comments to this blog. After a bit of thinking about it, though, I kinda wonder if this is really a good idea.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To explain, we have to go a bit back, around a year ago, if my memory recalls correctly. I posted a post similar to my &lt;a href=&#34;http://winnyace.codeberg.page/posts/personal_things/&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Personal Matters&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; post. The same day I posted it, some goons came on a Discord    server I was on and they saw that post and began to troll me over it. I have deleted it since then, because&amp;hellip; well, I don&amp;rsquo;t know why exactly, but I did. Remembering this event made me realize that if I had comments on my blog back then, they would have been there, trolling and generally make this place a ruckus.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Rambles: Long time no see.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yo! Long time no see. I have began university, at computer science. Things have been mixed, but mostly well. I kinda just want to do a post to say that I&amp;rsquo;m here and I want to do stuff here. Not sure what, but I know want to do stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanna try to do blog posts that talk about random stuff, either in my life or online that I have an interest in and that sparked my own curiosity. I wanna try to bring back the osu! improvement week thing, but that will happen in the summer. I even want to try and begin making videos and stuff, but I don&amp;rsquo;t know how that would work. There are a lot of things that I wanna do, but I can&amp;rsquo;t lie when I say that I am scared to do them. I make this blog post part because I wanted to do so for some time, but also because this week has been &lt;strong&gt;really&lt;/strong&gt; difficult for me. I have some things to say and hopefully learn from, but I will try to take them one at a time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi. Due to me getting slightly sick and also not enough scores to show, I decided to not do this week and I&amp;rsquo;ll lump week 3 and 4 into one. I&amp;rsquo;m sorry for the inconvenience and I hope that I&amp;rsquo;ll show some good stuff next week.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, world!
I&amp;rsquo;m currently still trying to put everything together for the blog and website. right now, for some reason, the new style isn&amp;rsquo;t being implemented, which is kind of annoying. I had to delete my previous repo for this to work, sadly. it&amp;rsquo;s fine now, though. I&amp;rsquo;m glad how well this turned up to be. now, for the future. I&amp;rsquo;m not too sure what I will do here, but I know I want to do something and hopefully share on my little bit of knowledge I&amp;rsquo;ve and leave my mark on this world, somehow. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably talk about&amp;hellip; whatever goes through my mind at a current time about a topic, really. we&amp;rsquo;ll see. for the time being, though, hello world!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
