    <p>Hi! Over the last summer, I’ve gotten the Need for Speed itch. Thus, I’ve decided to play a title I have never fully played: ProStreet. Getting it to work on Linux was a bit of a challenge, however, so I decided to document how I was able to install the game and play it.
Necessary files and programs The first thing you need is the game. The game isn’t available for purchase anymore, unless you buy it second hand. As such, here’s a link to an archive of the game. It will have the game with the latest official patch, which is still a bit broken.

    <p>Hi! Long time no see.
Have you ever struggled with motivation? Because I do, all the time. It is a pain in the butt. Especially when you’re bored and you wonder what you could do to not be bored, like me right now, or when you have an important exam coming up and you just can’t be arsed to do anything for it. This is the situation I am in right now.

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Hi all! I have said in my most recent blog post that I want to add comments to this blog. After a bit of thinking about it, though, I kinda wonder if this is really a good idea.
To explain, we have to go a bit back, around a year ago, if my memory recalls correctly. I posted a post similar to my “Personal Matters” post. The same day I posted it, some goons came on a Discord server I was on and they saw that post and began to troll me over it. I have deleted it since then, because… well, I don’t know why exactly, but I did. Remembering this event made me realize that if I had comments on my blog back then, they would have been there, trolling and generally make this place a ruckus.

    <p>Yo! Long time no see. I have began university, at computer science. Things have been mixed, but mostly well. I kinda just want to do a post to say that I’m here and I want to do stuff here. Not sure what, but I know want to do stuff.
I wanna try to do blog posts that talk about random stuff, either in my life or online that I have an interest in and that sparked my own curiosity. I wanna try to bring back the osu! improvement week thing, but that will happen in the summer. I even want to try and begin making videos and stuff, but I don’t know how that would work. There are a lot of things that I wanna do, but I can’t lie when I say that I am scared to do them. I make this blog post part because I wanted to do so for some time, but also because this week has been really difficult for me. I have some things to say and hopefully learn from, but I will try to take them one at a time.

    <p>Hi! For as long as I’ve used Linux, it wasn’t super popular with mainstream desktop usage, even amongst people that I consider to be nerdy or knowledgeable in this topic. I’ve tried many times to bring people over, oftentimes being met with failure. If you don’t mind a confession, I used to think that many people who didn’t want even try Linux were just… dumb. Lazy and dumb people, blinded by Windows’s and MacOS’s marketing. “Why can’t they see this as the better OS?” is what I said to myself oftentimes.

    </h2>

  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Hi! I’ve realized that, since my last configuration post, things have changed, quite a bit. I’d like to talk about them and some of the things that I still haven’t ironed out yet. Let’s begin!
First, my desktop environment: for a long time, I’ve used XFCE4 as my main DE. I’ve tried window managers like stock Openbox before, or desktop environments like GNOME or Cinnamon, but currently, KDE Plasma is the destkop environment I use. XFCE still has a soft spot in my heart, but currently, Plasma is the best in-between for me. It has the fast performance when I want that and nice animations and eye candy when I want that. It has every feature I want/need and I think it’s more feature rich than XFCE. Some might say too feature rich, but I somewhat like that. I don’t think it is as polished as GNOME, for example the calculator apps (yes, apps, because KDE seems to have separated different types of calculators in different apps) are lacking compared to GMOME’s calculator, but Plasma doesn’t feel as restricted as GNOME, which is something I really like. I would like to revisit GNOME some time later this year and lay down everything I like and don’t about it.

    <h2 class="entry-hint-parent">A little story of an old laptop and Linux
    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Hi! Happy New Year! Today, I bring you a little story. It’s a bit of a sad one, at least for me, but I think one that would be interesting. Let’s begin!
Last week, I got quite sick. It wasn’t anything too bad, but it was enough to make me not able to go to school and not being able to go to school means that I had a lot of free time on my hands and I had to do something with it. This is where a little laptop imported from Germany comes in. This laptop was brought by dad, from one of his colleagues at work. It is a Vista era machine by Acer, an Aspire 5315 to be exact, with a ground-breaking and absolutely monstrous Intel Celeron with a whopping 2GB of RAM on board, with a max of 2GB of RAM on board!! Absolutely fantastic… fantastically bad, I think for the time and especially now. It was enough to get you by then, doing simple tasks. When it reached my hands, it had Windows 7 on it, but the OS was broken beyond repair. It also had a very noisy fan, but it was very charming. The bulkyness of it and the fact it had marker written letters on the keyboard, since it had the german layout written on it, it simply won me over. I found it adorable.

    </h2>
  </header>
  <div class="entry-content">
    <p>Hi! I’ve purchased recently a new mouse: a SteelSeries Rival 3. I had a Logitech G102 mouse before, but it sadly broke. Setting it up was a bit of a challenge, however. I want to show you today how to set it up using two programs: a CLI one for general configuration and a GUI one for the lighting on it. I’m doing this post mainly as a reference for setting up most functions of the mice as of November 2022, using Linux native software. I’m not sure if the SteelSeries software thing works under Wine or not and to be honest I don’t really want to try either. Most likely, in the future, this information will be out-of-date. This isn’t a review of the mice. This is just for setting it up for what I think is normal use. If you want a super quick opinion on it, though, it is great and works very well. With all of that out of the way, let’s get into setting this puppy up.
